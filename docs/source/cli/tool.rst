lmcache tool
============

The ``lmcache tool`` command groups offline analysis utilities bundled with
LMCache.

.. code-block:: bash

   lmcache tool <tool-name> <action> [options]

Currently two tools are available: ``cache-simulator`` and ``list-commands``.

.. note::

   ``cache-simulator`` depends on the optional ``plot`` extras
   (``sortedcontainers`` / ``matplotlib``). If they are not installed, the
   sub-command is silently omitted from the CLI. Install the extras to enable
   it.


cache-simulator
---------------

Replay LMCache lookup-hash JSONL logs through an LRU cache to measure the
KV-cache token hit rate. It has three actions:

.. code-block:: bash

   lmcache tool cache-simulator {simulate,sweep,gen-dataset} [options]

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Action
     - Description
   * - ``simulate``
     - Replay logs at a fixed cache capacity; print a text report and save a
       7-panel statistics PNG.
   * - ``sweep``
     - Sweep across a range of cache capacities and save a hit-rate vs.
       capacity PNG.
   * - ``gen-dataset``
     - Generate a ``vllm bench serve`` custom dataset (JSONL) from
       lookup-hash JSONL logs, preserving prefix-sharing structure.

Each action has its own flags. Run the built-in help for the full list:

.. code-block:: bash

   lmcache tool cache-simulator simulate --help
   lmcache tool cache-simulator sweep --help
   lmcache tool cache-simulator gen-dataset --help

list-commands
-------------

Inspect the CLI command tree that LMCache discovered at startup:

.. code-block:: bash

   lmcache tool list-commands
   lmcache tool list-commands --format json

The command reports each path, command name, help text, command type
(``group`` or ``command``), and depth. This is useful when adding or debugging
plugin-style CLI extensions because it shows which ``BaseCommand`` and
``CompositeCommand`` classes were registered without manual registry edits.
