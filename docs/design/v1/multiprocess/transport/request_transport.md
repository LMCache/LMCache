# Multiprocess Request Transport

## Motivation

Multiprocess RPC metadata used to be repeated in `RequestType`,
`ProtocolDefinition`, the `RequestClient` API, transport adapters, protobuf
services, and handler decorators. A new RPC could compile while one of those
registries was missing or inconsistent.

The transport boundary now has one Python contract and transport-owned wire
schemas:

```text
MP integration / SDK / benchmark
              |
              v
     RequestClientFactory  -- selects by URL scheme
              |
              v
         RequestClient     -- typed RPC contract
          /       \
         v         v
  ZMQ adapter   gRPC adapter
```

## Shared RPC contract

Methods marked with `@rpc_method` on `RequestClient` are the Python source of
truth. The method name is the stable operation name, its parameters define the
ordered payload types, and `MessagingFuture[T]` defines the response type.
`get_rpc_specs()` discovers these contracts at startup.

Business modules use `@request_handler` to declare only scheduling behavior:

```python
@request_handler(HandlerType.BLOCKING, requires_client_affinity=True)
def store(
    self,
    key: IPCCacheServerKey,
    instance_id: int,
    block_ids: list[list[int]],
    event_ipc_handle: bytes,
) -> tuple[bytes, bool]:
    ...
```

The operation normally comes from the handler name. The decorator accepts an
explicit `operation=` only for legacy implementation methods whose names cannot
yet match the public RPC. Discovery validates handler annotations against the
shared contract before either server starts.

## Transport implementations

`RequestClientFactory` selects an implementation by endpoint scheme:

| Scheme | Implementation |
|---|---|
| no scheme, `tcp`, `ipc`, `inproc` | ZMQ |
| `grpc`, `grpc+unix` | gRPC |

The gRPC adapter discovers generated service methods from protobuf descriptors.
Each snake-case descriptor method must match one shared RPC operation. Its
codec combines the protobuf message schema with the Python payload and response
types. Types needing a non-structural representation register an explicit
message codec under `grpc_impl/codecs/`.

The ZMQ adapter installs client methods from the same RPC specifications. IDs
1–33 remain frozen for compatibility with deployed clients and servers. New
operations use their stable string name on the wire and must not be added to
the legacy ID table. The server accepts both encodings.

## Adding an RPC

An ordinary RPC requires three changes:

1. Add one typed `@rpc_method` to `RequestClient`.
2. Add the protobuf request, response, and service method.
3. Add a same-named `@request_handler` method to a business module.

No request enum, Python protocol-definition registry, manual ZMQ client method,
or gRPC service registration list is required. Add a custom gRPC message codec
only when the structural codec cannot represent the Python type.

## Adding a transport

A new transport implements the `RequestClient` contract inside its own
subdirectory and adds its scheme mapping to the factory. Application code must
continue to depend only on `RequestClientFactory` and named request methods;
transport-specific serialization and connection management stay behind that
boundary.
