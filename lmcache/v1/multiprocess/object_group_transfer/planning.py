        The caller need to make sure that the block ids seen by
        transfer_kv_per_object_group are produced by this function.

    Example:
        If a model have 2 kernel groups, one is full attention with block size 32,
        one is swa attention with block size 32 and sliding window size 64, and
        LMCache has a chunk size of 128. And there are 2 chunks in total (256 tokens).
