"""Object-group KV transfer for the multiprocess server.

Per-kernel-group gather and scatter between the engine's paged KV cache and
LMCache memory objects, driven by the cache context's ``KVLayerGroupsManager``:
block-id downsampling for sub-chunk sliding windows, skip recalculation, and
the per-object-group transfer plan the copy kernels run.

Two copy paths are available, chosen per object group by
:func:`direct_transfer_supported`: the direct path moves each chunk straight
between the pinned host object and the paged buffers with one
``cudaMemcpyBatchAsync`` per chunk, and is used whenever the build, the driver
and the object group's layout allow it; everything else stages each chunk
through a GPU temp buffer and scatters it with the block transfer kernel. See
``docs/design/v1/multiprocess/lmcache_driven_transfer_copy_paths.md``.

    to/from GPU, with batching support.

    Args:
        cache_context: The GPU cache context containing the KV cache information.
        block_ids_gpu: GPU block IDs to retrieve into, indexed by LMCache KV group
            index. It should satisfy `len(block_ids_gpu[i]) == len(memory_objs) *
            blocks_per_chunk[i]` for each group `i`.
            Note that the block IDs list are already on GPU.
        memory_objs: The list of MemoryObj instances to copy from. It could be
            None when allocation or retrieval fails. For store (D2H), it should
            ignore the None entry and continue copying the rest. For retrieve
            (H2D), it should raise the error and stop copying.
        object_group_id: Index of the object group being copied.
        batch_size: The number of memory objects to perform batched copy
        skip_first_n_tokens: Number of tokens to skip writing at the start of
            the retrieve range. This avoids overwriting APC-shared GPU blocks that
            may be read concurrently by other requests.
        direction: The transfer direction, H2D (retrieve) or D2H (store).
        transfer_key: Identity of this store/retrieve operation, echoed back on
            every phase-timing sample; see _run_object_group_transfer_plan.
        block_ids_host: The same downsampled block ids as ``block_ids_gpu``,
            as host lists indexed by kernel group. Required for the direct
            copy path (see :func:`run_direct_transfer`); leave empty to force
            the kernel path.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If it founds None entry in memory_objs when direction is H2D.
    Note:
        This function expects the caller to stage the block ids (list[list[int]])
        into GPU tensors and pass them in as `block_ids_gpu`.
